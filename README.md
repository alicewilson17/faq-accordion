I've officially started my #100daysofcode challenge! 🚀

For day 1, I decided to go back to basics and build a simple FAQ accordion using HTML, CSS and javascript.

This was adapted from a challenge by Frontend Mentor, but I customised the design and content to make an FAQ page for my podcast, Flourish and Thrive🎙️

This was a great opportunity to revise my CSS styling, particularly working with flexbox, and also a good refresher on DOM manipulation. 

I really enjoyed playing around with the styling to match the branding of the podcast (lots of pink!). I also added a transition to ensure the accordion opens and closes smoothly, to improve the user experience.
